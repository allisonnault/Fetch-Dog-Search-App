# Fetch Frontend Take Home Exercise

view the [deployed site](https://allisonnault.github.io/Fetch-Dog-Search-App/)

## Description

This is a site to help dog-lovers search through a database of shelter dogs, with the hope of finding a lucky dog a new home!

Users are able to filter by breed, and set a minimum and maximum age range.

The results are shown 25 to a page, and the user is able to flip through the different pages.

They are able to add dogs from the search reults into a favorites list, that will then be used to match them with a single dog.
